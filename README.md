# WRAITH  
**Wireless Reconnaissance & Autonomous Interdiction Terminal Hub**

---

### 📡 Overview

**WRAITH** is a research-oriented, field-deployable tool designed to highlight risks associated with unencrypted UAV telemetry links that use the MAVLink protocol. It passively monitors for MAVLink heartbeat messages and, upon detection, can autonomously execute predefined scripts for simulation or training purposes in explicitly authorized environments.

WRAITH was developed to support ethical security research, red team training, and system hardening exercises where telemetry encryption is absent or weak. It does not interact with encrypted traffic, perform denial-of-service attacks, or target commercial systems.

### 🧰 Core Features

- Passive MAVLink heartbeat detection
- Autonomous payload scripting (via Python)
- Real-time .log file creation for event tracking
- Headless operation with systemd auto-start
- Discord webhook integration for push alerts (optional)
- Runs within Python virtual environment for isolation

---

### ⚙️ Setup & Usage

#### Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Run the Listener

```bash
python3 launch_wraith.py
```

This will start passive monitoring. Logs will appear in:
```
~/mav_hunter/logs/
```

#### Simulate Payloads (Dry Run)

```bash
python3 mav_hunter/mavlink_payload_cli.py --spoof --reboot --dry-run
```

### 🧪 Testing with QGroundControl

- Set up a UDP link in QGroundControl:
  - Port: 14551
  - Target: `<Your Pi IP>:14550`
- Start a drone or simulator sending telemetry
- WRAITH will log heartbeats and simulate payloads
